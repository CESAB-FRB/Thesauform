		We do hope you will contribute to the creation of a thesaurus for ecological observations!
	</div>
	<div id="para1">
		Common and understandable terminology is essential for sharing data and information. The lack of clear terminology and definitions of those terms is very evident in a
		synthesis centre, where our business is to assist researchers to aggregate existing data. In some fields, such as in the identification
		and definition of plant traits, we are well progressed, but in others much less so.
	</div>
	<div id="para2">
		This tool is designed to help you contribute
		clear definitions on the following:
		<ul>
			<li>what you use to describe
				your ecological observations and measurements, and 
			</li>
			<li>what do the terms you use mean?
			</li> 
		</ul> 
	</div>
	<div id="para3">
		We hope that once a good suite of terms has been defined, the thesaurus will become a public resource, linked to
		global thesauri and ontologies such as ENVO &lt;<a href="http://environmentontology.org/">http://environmentontology.org/</a> &gt;.
