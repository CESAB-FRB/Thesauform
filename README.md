# Thesauform

#Description: 

Thesauform is a tool written in java and running on a web server to help scientists to produce their own thesaurus 
easily. 
The thesaurus is represented by a tree. The user has the capacity to vote for the propositions, and there are some basic tools to export data.

#Installation: 

The Thesauform uses several external libraries, but they are not the most recent (jena is the major one). For this reason, the jar are directly included in the war.
Many local javascript librairies are included (e.g. jquery,jstree and jqplot).
The best way to use the Thesauform is to use the war file. It has been tested under tomcat8.
You need to modifify the .properties file to adapt the Thesauform to your needs.
